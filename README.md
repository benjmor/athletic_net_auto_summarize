# AthleticSummary.net

Generates a human-readable summary of Athletic.net athletics results using Generative AI.

Supports both Track and Cross-Country meets.

# Usage

This solution now runs as a website! Just provide your school ID (number from the URL when you look at the team page) and the website will pull results from the latest meet with results.

Optionally, you can provide a specific meet ID (again, pull it from the meet URL) and the website will generate a report for that meet.

Review the output, edit as needed, and post on your website, social media, school newspaper, or just send it to grandma and grandpa.
