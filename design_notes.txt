# Get the latest meet that has results
Should look something like:
f"https://www.athletic.net/{SPORT_PASCAL_CASE}/meet/{MEET_ID}/info"
# Grab the following information from the meet result:

When was the meet?
Where was the meet held?
How many teams were present?
Get each result:
    Name of the race
    Distance of the race
    Team score
    Team place (and how close they were to other teams in the meet).
    All runners, with data on whether their result was a personal/season best (need to consult against the results grid)
